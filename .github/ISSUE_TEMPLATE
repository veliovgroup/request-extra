### I'm having an issue:
  - Give an expressive description of what is went wrong
  - Version of `request-extra` you're experiencing this issue
  - Version of `Node.js`, `NPM` and `MongoDB` you're experiencing this issue
  - If you're getting an error (exception), please provide full error log (output in console) as file or screenshot

### I have a suggestion:
  - Describe your feature / request
  - How you're going to use it? Give a usage example(s)

### Documentation is missing something or incorrect (have typos, etc.):
  - Give a short description what you have changed/added and why
  - Make sure you're using correct markdown markup
  - Make sure all code blocks starts with triple ``` (*backtick*) and have a syntax tag, for more read [this docs](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/#syntax-highlighting)
  - Post addition/changes as issue ticket, we will manage it
     
## Thank you for contribution, and do not forget to get rid of this default message
